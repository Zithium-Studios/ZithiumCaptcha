# SaveCaptcha
A simple plugin to display a gui with a randomized item which a user must click to close.

# What is this for?
I made this to use together with my anticheat plugin to display the captcha to users who are suspected of afking auto clicking. As a way to limit the amount of profit they can make.

# Commands
- /captcha show {username} - Displays the captcha menu to the target user.

# Permissions
- captcha.admin - Access to all commands
- captcha.command.show - Access to the show command.


# Future Plans
- Reload Command
- Configurable Menu
- Configurable Messages
